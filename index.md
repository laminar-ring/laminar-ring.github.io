## laminar ring

Laminar ring is a metallic labyrinth seal consisting of multiple rings in a groove. laminar rings are used as sealing elements for rotating and static sealing applications. our laminar rings are produced in-house and are high quality.

In addition to laminar ring's outstanding sealing characteristics for rotating components, the low contact laminar rings with low friction produce a significant reduction of internal heat and wear, which qualifies laminar ring for high speed applications and applications in temperature and/or friction sensitive installations.

For static sealing applications such as axial compensation at screwed exhaust manifold systems for internal combustion engines, exhaust gas re-circulation systems and power units with operating temperatures of up to +600°C, laminar rings will be manufactured from chrome nickel materials, which are spring and heat resistant in the laminar ring sealing area even at high temperatures.
